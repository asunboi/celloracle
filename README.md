All sbatch files are just associated with the corresponding python script for submission.

auc.py is used for extracting the AUC scores from all the caluclated GRNs. Perturbation of the gene of interest is a total knockout. (Depreciated by auroc.py)

auroc.py generates all statistics generated by auc.py, alongside AUROC graphs. Songpeng matching of regions is incomplete so it may be ommitted from some graphs.

deg_grn.py generates all GRNs for perturbseq, ctrl, goi subsets of data for all replicates and regions. DEG from sean's analysis is used to determine the GRN gene set.

songpeng_calculations.py is used to generate GRNs from songpeng's data.
